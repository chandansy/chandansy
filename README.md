### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I am a 23 years old engineer who wants to get started in the world of AI, image processing and computer vision. 👨‍🎓

Since a year, I am a self-taught Data Analyst in the vast world of ChatGPT, AI and Data Science . 📱

Why not learn the machine learning and deep learning to become a data scientist soon? 🧠

### 🔭 Projects

For some time, I have been working on projects that are close to my heart and that come out of my head during my spare time:
- [Gemu](), v1 of a social network application for people interested in e-sport and video games developed in Flutter linked to a Firebase server 🔜 Why not have a version 2, case to follow...
- [My youkounkoun](), an application made from scratch which is meant to be an application with a huge variety of basics and complex features very useful when creating a new application. Why start from scratch every time? The front-end application is developed with Flutter and the back-end will be developed in Node.js link to MySQL database.

Hopefully in the future, many other projects straight out of my imagination! 🤔

💼 **Learning:** coding, communicating but also listening, calm and peace. Becoming the best version of myself.

❤️ **Passion (at night):** constant search for new features, optimizations and fixing different bugs on a project (what a relief 😅)

🎧 **Music:** Wherever I go and whatever I do, music will follow me everywhere to escape
